        <p>My name is Caitmeleon! I have worked in IT since college with a BS in Industrial Engineering. Shortly after graduating, I took a position that trained me in Java for a few months. Upon completetion, I started working full time for a large company as a front end/mobile developer. My family was relocated several states away and I found a new job in the IT department for a university. This is where I am now! I work with SQL/Bash mostly, but I've also begun creating small pages for the univeristy. I manage two/three student workers as well. I've recently obtained a MS in Information Systems.
