<p class='disclaimer card'>Welcome to my page! <br> As you can see this is a work in progress. I appreciate your patience as I work to improve it.</p>

    	<h3 class='cardHeader'>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p> I hope to be able to share more about my hobbies/interest here and upload photos and guides of some completed projects. I enjoy crocheting, sewing, gardening, and playing video games. </p>

    	<h3 class='cardHeader'>Crocheting</h3>
        <p> The most ambitious crocheting project I undertook recently is a c2c baby blanket for a coworker.</p>

    	<h3 class='cardHeader'>Sewing</h3>
        <p> I'm just starting with sewing and so far have started a seasonal table runner and stockings.</p>

    	<h3 class='cardHeader'>Gardening</h3>
        <p>It's winter now, and looking at the foot of snow on the ground, I can't wait for spring again. Last year, we were able to set up a small raised bed and planted peppers, tomatoes, strawberries and some herbs. I'm going to begin planning the garden for next year soon!</p>

    	<h3 class='cardHeader'>Video Games</h3>
        <p>I enjoy relaxing with video games. I've been playing Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and The Sims recently. As you can probably piece together, I enjoy simulation games mostly. </p> 
		<p>I have a VR headset and have been developing plans to start doing some simple programming with that. </p>
