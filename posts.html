     	<p> <u>SQL tidbit:</u> If you've recently just returned from an extended vacation and find yourself struggling to remember your job is including what you usually do in a day, how you do it, etc.. I recommend remembering the <b>trunc</b> function. Just because the dates look the same when you select them doesn't mean they are the same. The <b>trunc</b> function allows you to compare two date fields without the timestamps. </p>
        <p> <u>Manager tidbit:</u> GA's may ask questions concerning jobs and recruiters that you are not sure of the answer to. I encourage to always answer as thoroughly as honestly as able, but I also might encourage sending them to do some research on it first (while you quickly do some searches yourself). Today's question was how to appropriately reach out to a recruiter. The current recommended path is to write up a cover letter of sorts that lays out pertinent information such as degree (including classes and skills), the desired type of position, and a quick synopsis of what makes the candidate stand out from others. <p>

        <p> This is just the beginning! I wanted a way to keep track of everything and this seemed like a fun way. I enjoy building web pages, so why not? I hope to improve this site over time as I learn and improve myself.</p>
